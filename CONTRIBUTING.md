# Contributing

While paginator.js was mainly created for my friends and I to use in our bots, we decided to release the module to help others. With that said, we understand this is a
specific use case type module. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bits of code you would like to add we welcome you to do so! All we ask is that you follow a simple set
of guides: 

## 1. Create an Issue

Create an issue on the issues tab of this repository. You can view what we look for in a good issue, [here](/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). Creating a pull request not only allows us to
keep track of community improvements but also allows us to keep a log of changes over time and discern whether the project is popular enough to continue maintaining or whether
our efforts would be better spent on a module that may be more in need.

## 2. Fork this repository

We do not allow for commiting improvements straight to the main branch for good reason. To prevent untentionally breaking the module, we ask that all contributors fork the 
repository, make their changes to the fork and then submit a pull request into main from your fork. 

## 3. Create a pull request

Once you have added your proposed changes, go ahead and make a pull request. Make sure your pull requests description accurately describes the changes you made, your changes 
intended use case and how you expect it to run. Speak about any difficulties or work around you had to do whether originally a part of your plan or otherwise. Community members
may know how to help and get your code to the place you originally intended. 

**IMPORTANT** Link your issue to your pull request. Linking your issue will close your issue if the 
pull request is merged to main. We want to make sure we are keeping the issues page clean.
